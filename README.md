# Java 2D Zombie Game
A Java 2D Game I developed in order to get into the Java language and understand OOP concepts. It uses sprite sheets to animate its characters and visualize its world. In the future, I plan to add level generation and more enemies, as well as weapons.

**Project on hold for now.**
